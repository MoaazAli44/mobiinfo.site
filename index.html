  <div class="container">


    <p class="lead">
      phone Although most of us feel like we couldn't live without our mobile they've not really been in existence for very long. </br>
      In fact, mobile phones as we know them today have only been around in the last 20 years.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-center wow zoomIn"data-wow-duration="3s">When were mobile phones invented?</h1>

      <p class="lead">

        Mobile phones, particularly the smartphones that have become our inseparable companions today, are relatively new. <br><br>
        However, the history of mobile phones goes back to 1908 when a US Patent was issued  for a wireless telephone.<br><br>
        Mobile phones were invented as early as the 1940s when engineers working at AT&T developed cells for mobile phone. <br><br>
        The very first mobile phones were not really mobile phones at all. They were two-way radios that allowed people like taxi drivers and the emergency services to communicate. <br><br>
        Instead of relying on base stations with separate cells (and the signal being passed from one cell to another), the first mobile phone networks involved one very powerful base station covering a much wider area. <br><br>
        Motorola, on <span>" 3 April 1973 " </span>were first company to mass produce the the first handheld mobile phone.<br><br>
        These early mobile phones are often to as <span>0G</span> mobile phones, . Most phones today rely on <span>3G</span> or <span>4G</span>   mobile technology.
      </p>

      <h1 class="text-center wow zoomIn"data-wow-duration="3s">Landmarks in mobile history</h1>

      <p class="lead">
        Mobile telephony has a long history that started off with experiments of communications from and to moving vehicle rather then handheld devices. <br><br>
        In later years, the main challenges have laid in the development of interoperable standard and coping with the explosive success and ever increasing demand for bandwidth and reliability. <br><br>
    <span> 1926 : </span>The first successful mobile telephony service was offered to first class passengers on the Deutsche Reichsbahn on the route between Berlin and Hamburg. <br><br>
    <span> 1946 : </span>The first calls were made on a car radiotelephone in Chicago. Due to the small number of radio frequencies available, the service quickly reached capacity. <br><br>
    <span> 1956 : </span>The first automated mobile phone system for private vehicles launched in Sweden. The device to install in the car used vacuum tube technology with rotary dial and weighed 40Kg. <br><br>

          <p class="lead">
            <span> 1969 : </span>The Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) Group was established. It included engineers representing Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland. Its purpose was to develop a mobile phone system that, unlike the systems being introduced in US.<br><br>

            <span> 1973 : </span>Dr Martin Cooper general manager at Motorola communications system division made the first public mobile phone call on a device that weighed 1.1Kg.<br><br>

            <span> 1982 : </span>Engineers and administrators from eleven European countries gathered in Stockholm to consider whether a Europe wide digital cellular phone system was technically and politically possible.<br><br>

            <span> 1985 : </span>Comedian Ernie Wise made the first “public” mobile phone call in the UK from outside the Dicken’s Pub in St Catherine’s dock to Vodafone’s HQ. He made the call in full Dickensian coachman’s garb.<br><br>

            <span> 1987 : </span>The Technical specifications for the GSM standard are approved. Based on digital technology, it focused on interoperability across national boundaries and consequent different frequency bands, call quality and low costs.<br><br>

            <span> 1992 : </span>The world’s first ever SMS message was sent in the UK. Neil Papworth, aged 22 at the time was a developer for a telecom contractor tasked with developing a messaging service for Vodafone. The text message read “Merry Christmas”.<br><br>

            <span> 1996/97 : </span>UK phone ownership stood at 16% of households. A decade later the figure was 80%. The explosion in growth was in part driven the launch of the first pay as you go, non-contract phone service, Vodafone Prepaid, in 1996.<br><br>

            <span> 1998 : </span>The first downloadable content sold to mobile phones was the ringtone, launched by Finland's Radiolinja, laying the groundwork for an industry that would eventually see the Crazy Frog ringtone rack up total earnings of half a billion dollars.<br><br>
